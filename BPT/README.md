Python3 implementations of a new tree boosting algorithm designed for learning parametrizations of systematic uncertainties.

The accompanying publication can be found as FIXME <>[preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10859).

The results from the toy model in Fig. 3 can be obtained by running 
```bash
python bpt_training.py
```
